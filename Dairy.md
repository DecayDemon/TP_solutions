I just want to help beginners a bit and this program is open, no copyright reserved. Since I am still reading Think Python, I will update this repository as soon as I can. I am also working on competitive programming, even I am a beginner myself. Good luck to all my fellows at XJTLU.

###_21/12/2016_
This is time to re-pick up python and sharpen my skills as computer science undergraduate. So I revised the exercises I did and make it easier to understand and comment more appropriately according to programming convention.  Today due to low effiency I only revised chapter 1 to 4

###_22/12/2016_
I only revised chapter 4 to 8 today. Although I found it is really interesting to combine math and programming. I worked out a couple of mathematical proof and understood deeper about math, including Bezout's identity, estimating pi with Srinivasa Ramanujan's eqution and etc.

###_23/12/2016_
Nah, I did not do much today. I experienced smog once again, feeling terrible.

###_24/12/2016_
Christmas Eve, but I am not stay at home so meh I think I will do more exerices than yesterday. I have to admit my effiency is really really low today and stuck in maths again!

????????! Hyv‰‰ joulua! Merry Christmas!
xmas.py is for celebrating in spite of its ugliness
Even using a same idea to implement, the result could be dramatically different, see ex10_11.py

### _30/12/2016_
I was reviewing all the materials from school recently but figured out it could be better to finish all the exercise before the exams. So here we are.

### _31/12/2016_
The last day of this year, but I am still stuck with a lot of exercises in the book. I don't think I am able to finish in this year. So good luck to next year. ???????!

Arrr, back to work.

### _11/01/2017_
Low effiency :/ I did 2 different versions for exercise 12-1, 12-2.

### _14/01/2017_
Finally finish chapter 12, takes a whole day to do exercise 12-4 and read a lot posts on stackoverflow. I tried several methods but found the author's answer is still best, so I rewrote the code in my own way (actually the same). A friend told me another way of solving exercise 12-4 which is interesting (a bottom-up approach), I will definitely try the method later!

For now, let me skip it and chapter 13, will come back later next week.

### _20/01/2017_
Finished chapter 14. A lot side-projects I was participating also happened those days. Need more time :/

### _21/01/2017_
When I looked back at the code I wrote a year ago, I felt what the heck did I wrote. But I believe with my skill improving, my coding habit will be more reliable and easier to debug for future use.

### _22/01/2017_
I started to feel even when everyone can have access to Internet and learn anything, humans are still just animals. By that I mean there are universal behaviors and habits we inherit. No matter how hard we try, the behavior is still there and we cannot get rid of it as long as we are made of same elements.


### _23/01/2017_
I was lightheaded after going back to home. My usual living habits are violated and things turns to be not working as well. I am surrounded by people and feel sick. Life should be back to track from this day. Looking forward to it. 

Chapter 16 is mostly about datetime manipulation. 

### _28/01/2017_
Today is Chinese new year. Since I am currently living in China, I decided to do something different, like finish chapter 13. :)

### _31/01/2017_
The last day of January. How long did I wrote for this book already? (About one and a half month!) After all the exercises I did, I felt _PYTHONIC IS BEAUTIFUL_!!! Besides, the author's are witty and knowledgeable. So I really enjoyed his book.
