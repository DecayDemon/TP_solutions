Hi there! This is my approach to _think python_ written by Allen Downey. You can see his book [there](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) and I adapted his answers in some of solutions (see my code to find out where). To find a particular exercise, you can search through the index. Cheers!
