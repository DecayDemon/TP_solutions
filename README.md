I just want to help beginners a bit and this program is open, no copyright reserved. Since I am still reading Think Python, I will update this repository as soon as I can. I am also working on competitive programming, even I am a beginner myself. Good luck to all my fellows at XJTLU.

This is time to re-pick up python and sharpen my skills as computer science undergraduate. So I revised the exercises I did and make it easier to understand and comment more appropriately according to programming convention.  Today due to low effiency I only revised chapter 1 to 4

I only revised chapter 4 to 8 today. Although I found it is really interesting to combine math and programming. I worked out a couple of mathematical proof and understood deeper about math, including Bezout's identity, estimating pi with Srinivasa Ramanujan's eqution and etc.

メリークリスマス! Hyvää joulua! Merry Christmas!
xmas.py is for celebrating in spite of its ugliness
Even using a same idea to implement, the result could be dramatically different, see ex10_11.py
