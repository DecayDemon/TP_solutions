I just want to help beginners a bit and this program is open, no copyright reserved. Since I am still reading Think Python, I will update this repository as soon as I can. I am also working on competitive programming, even I am a beginner myself. Good luck to all my fellows at XJTLU.

###_21/12/2016_
This is time to re-pick up python and sharpen my skills as computer science undergraduate. So I revised the exercises I did and make it easier to understand and comment more appropriately according to programming convention.  Today due to low effiency I only revised chapter 1 to 4

###_22/12/2016_
I only revised chapter 4 to 8 today. Although I found it is really interesting to combine math and programming. I worked out a couple of mathematical proof and understood deeper about math, including Bezout's identity, estimating pi with Srinivasa Ramanujan's eqution and etc.

###_23/12/2016_
Nah, I did not do much today. I experienced smog once again, feeling terrible.

###_24/12/2016_
Christmas Eve, but I am not stay at home so meh I think I will do more exerices than yesterday. I have to admit my effiency is really really low today and stuck in maths again! 

###_25/12/2016_
メリークリスマス! Hyvää joulua! Merry Christmas!
xmas.py is for celebrating in spite of its ugliness
Even using a same idea to implement, the result could be dramatically different, see ex10_11.py

### _30/12/2016_
I was reviewing all the materials from school recently but figured out it could be better to finish all the exercise before the exams. So here we are.

### _31/12/2016_
The last day of this year, but I am still stuck with a lot of exercises in the book. I don't think I am able to finish in this year. So good luck to next year. 皆さんあけおめ!

### _11/01/2017_
Arrr, back to work.

### _11/01/2017_
Low effiency :/ I did 2 different versions for exercise 12-1, 12-2.

### _14/01/2017_
Finally finish chapter 12, takes a whole day to do exercise 12-4 and read a lot posts on stackoverflow. I tried several methods but found the author's answer is still best, so I rewrote the code in my own way (actually the same). A friend told me another way of solving exercise 12-4 which is interesting (a bottom-up approach), I will definitely try the method later!

For now, let me skip it and chapter 13, will come back later next week.
