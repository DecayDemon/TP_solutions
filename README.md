I just want to help beginners a bit and this program is open, no copyright reserved. Since I am still reading Think Python, I will update this repository as soon as I can. I am also working on competitive programming, even I am a beginner myself. Good luck to all my fellows at XJTLU.

This is time to re-pick up python and sharpen my skills as computer science undergraduate. So I revised the exercises I did and make it easier to understand and comment more appropriately according to programming convention.  Today due to low effiency I only revised chapter 1 to 4

I only revised chapter 4 to 8 today. Although I found it is really interesting to combine math and programming. I worked out a couple of mathematical proof and understood deeper about math, including Bezout's identity, estimating pi with Srinivasa Ramanujan's eqution and etc.
