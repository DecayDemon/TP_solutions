##Reading notes:

1. two kinds of programs process high level language into low level language: interpreter & compiler

2. source code -> interpreter -> outputx
3. source code -> compiler -> object code -> executor -> output

4. program: a program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
5. script: the contents stored in form of a file
6. value: one of the basic units of data, like a number or string, that a program manipulates.
7. type: a category of values.
8. variable: a name that refers to a value.
9. argument: the expression in parentheses

!question: why display the numbers start with 0 makes it bizarre?

*note: page 20 has many definitions

9. two types of partition table:
	(1)MBR: Master Boot Record
 	(2)GPT: GUID Partition Table
	
10. flow of execution: the order in which statement are executed

11. Function: a named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.
12. function definition: a statement that creates a new function, specifying its name, parameters, and the statements it excutes.
13. function object: a value created by a function definition. The name of the function is a variable that refers to a function object.

14. instance: a member of set

15. encapsulation: wrap a piece of code up in a function.
16. generaliztion: add a parameter to a function
17. interface of a function: a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is "clean" if it is "as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)"

18. A development plan: a process for writing programs.
	(1) Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.
	(2) Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.
	(3) Generalize the functionn by adding appropriate parameters.
	(4) Repeat steps 1-3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to aviod retyping( and re-bugging)
	(5) Loot for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider facotring it into an appropriately general function.

#V. Chapter 5

19. modulus operator: %
20. boolean expressions: either true or false
21. logical operators: and, or, not
22. conditional execution: if
23. alternative execution: else, elif
24. chained conditionals: 2+ branches
25. nested conditionals
26. recursion
27. stack diagram for recursive function.
    (1)n = 0, base case
	(2)
28. infinite recursion
29. keyboard input --> raw_input() 
30. guardian
31. debuging:
			there are three possiblities here:
				(1)There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition is violated.
				(2)There is something wrong with the function; a post condition is violated.
				(3)These is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.
