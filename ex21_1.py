#Answering questions

# 1. What is the order of growth of n^3 + n^2? What about 1000000*n^3 + n^2? What about n^3 + 1000000 * n^2?

# The answer is cubic, O(x^3). When n approaches infinite, the constant and n^2 does not matter

# 2. What is the order of growth of n2 + n Â· n + 1 ? Before you start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading term.

# cubic, O(x^3)

3. If f is in O(g), for some unspecified function g , what can we say about af+b?

If a is constant, I think the answer should be same as O(g)
