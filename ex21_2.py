1. What is a "comparison sort"? What is the best worst-case order of growth for a comparison sort? What is the best worst-case order of growth for any sort algorithm?

Ans: All comparison sorts has a property that the sorting order it determined is based only on the comprisons between the input elements. (b) The best scenario is O(nlogn)  (c) For radix sort, the order of growth is 


2. What is the order of growth of bubble sort, and does Barack Obama think it is "the wrong way to go"?


Ans: The asymptotic complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2)


3. What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?


4. What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?


5. What is the worst sorting algorithm (that has a name)?

6. What sort algorithm does the C library use? What sort algorithm does Python use? Are these algorithms stable?

7. Many of the non-comparison sorts are linear, so why does Python use an O(nlogn) comparison sort?
